# Enhancement Tracking

This repo contains Vitess Enhancement Proposals (VEP), which are assigned a numeric value to track the proposal. VEPs are inspired by similar proposal systems such as what is used in [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements) and [Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/).

## The Process

To propose a new enhancement, we recommend creating a _new issue_ to describe the use case. The issue helps spawn initial discussion, and find potential co-collaborators. From here, a VEP number will be assigned. Please then create a pull request referring to the VEP number with the full proposal.
